This is a simple Todo list app under development.
Created with Flask, Sqlite, Html, CSS, Bootstrap.

Many more features comming soon!. 

The significance of this project is that I got stuck with a simple error and got me stuck for days.

This special app got me stuck for 5 days just because of a comment syntax error. I had used VScode shortcut (ctrl+/) to comment out many lines of code inside the html file. VScode had used the standard Html comments syntax for jinja2 lines as well inside the html file, where as the actual syntax for comments in jija2 (python) is '#'. VScode even color coded those lines to make it seem like they are commented.
This raised many errors, which I failed to figure out and got me stuck for 5 days. Such a classic newb!!.
